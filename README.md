# policyHack

Event of 18-19th April 2015...

We created a game in which a consumer will be given some products to purchase, in th given time limit. He will be given some real products and fake products and he has to choose a real one. On the choosing the wrong one, he will be penalised. And at the end final score will be assigned. If score is less some tips will be given at the end.
